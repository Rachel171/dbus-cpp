dbus-c++
========
 
A fork of the dbus-c++ library at version 0.7.0 with fixes.

DBus-c++ attempts to provide a C++ API for D-BUS. The library has a glib and an Ecore mainloop integration. It also offers an optional own main loop. and the example mydbus contains some frame.

The other patches are for bugs discovered at Stratus, the new version is 0.9.0.
